# Java-Project-ATM-Bank-Management-

This is my first Java project, a bank management/ATM application. Some of its features are:
-create new account
-login
-deposit
-withdraw
-transfer
-transaction history and many more

The project can be improved by adding exception handling, which I will do in the future as well as an user interface and a database.

-Disclaimer-
I found the idea on the internet, but I wrote and implemented the code on my own.
