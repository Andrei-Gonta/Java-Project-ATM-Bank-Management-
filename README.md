## ATM-Bank-Management

This is my first Java project, a bank management/ATM application. 
The project has 2 files:
1. Account.java -- contains the account class and all the options/actions that can be executed on an account;
2. Main.java -- contains the main method, "display menu" method along with the options that can be executed when interacting with the app for the first time.

Some of the project's features are:
1. create new account
2. login
3. deposit
4. withdraw
5. transfer
6. transaction history and many more.
   
The project can be improved by adding exception handling, which I will do in the future as well as an user interface and a database.

### DISCLAIMER
I found the idea on the internet, but I wrote and implemented the code on my own! I also added new personal features in order to make the application more complex!
